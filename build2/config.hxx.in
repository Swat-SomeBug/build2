// Currently the value is adjusted manually during release but in the future
// the idea is to use version metadata (e.g., 1.2.3-a.1+0.stage). This way it
// will all be managed in a central place (manifest), we can teach the version
// module to extract it, and we can also set it for the other packages in the
// toolchain. Bootstrap will be a problem though. (Maybe set it to nullptr and
// say that it shall not be queried?)
