# Commonly-used build system test project setup and driver command line.
#

# If the includer indicated that no cross-testing should be supported, then
# use the build system driver that is building, not the one being built.
#
# In many cases expecting a cross-compiled driver to perform a native build
# under emulation is pushing things a bit too far. Plus, we have no way of
# knowing the native compiler name/path.
#
# So the idea here is to test cross-compilation with the understanding that
# the build system driver we are testing is not the one being cross-compiled
# but rather the one doing the cross-compilation.
