- Normally variable names should be like C-identifiers plus '.'. In
  particular, in simple expansion (i.e., $package-$version) we assume
  characters [/-] end the name. But this can be overrident with paren-
  expansion (i.e., $(package-version)). In assignment we always use
  full name until space, '=', or '=+'.
